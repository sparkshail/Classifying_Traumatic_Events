# Investigation of EEG Waveforms that Characterize Traumatic Events
## Determining which EEG brain waves classify traumatic events using ML algorithms, principle component analysis, feature selection, and temporal data reduction. 

Many Emergency Department (ER) workers are consistently exposed to high-stress environments. These conditions can lead to long term mental health issues, including Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and even Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. To examine the affect of stress on the human brain, brain wave data is extracted using a mobile electroencephalography biomonitoring device. We develop a multiclassification algorithm that can predict the level of trauma at a given instance with over 90\% accuracy. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to drastically reduce data size while maintaining accuracy.

We compare the accuracy of 4 different classifiers: 
1. Ridge Regression
2. Supoort Vector Machines
3. Artificial Nueral Network
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis
5. K-nearest nieghbor
